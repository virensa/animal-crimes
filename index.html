        <p>Anyone or anything can commit a crime. Crimes happen all the time, everywhere, always. Sometimes we forget that crimes can be petty little things rather than some grandiose heist where you steal the royal jewels and take down some guards in the process! But sometimes... if someone especially cute is committing the crime... </p>
