        <p>Anyone or anything can commit a crime. Crimes happen all the time, everywhere, always. Sometimes we forget that crimes can be petty little things rather than some grandiose heist where you steal the royal jewels and take down some guards in the process! But sometimes... if someone especially cute is committing the crime... </p>

    Let's now look at some other crimes. 
     That were committed by humans.
     Who made choices that had consequences
     and didn't get away with it,
     because they aren't considered
     to be as cute
     as little animals doing crimes.
